              I was born and raised in Tanzania, in a region known as Shinyanga.
              I studied in Tanzania from my kindergarten to university. I left
              Tanzania in 2017 after I got a scholarship for my masters studies
              in Finland. <br />
              <br />
              I am currently living in Germany with my husband in a small town
              called Osnabrück. The weather in Germany is better than Finland.
              It is still cold though, not as much compared to Finland.

              The United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in East Africa
              bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north, Rwanda, Burundi and the
              Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west, and Zambia, Malawi
              and Mozambique to the south. To the east it borders the Indian
              Ocean. <br />
              <br />
              Tanzania is a result of the unification of Tanganyika (the
              mainland) and the Zanzibar islands. Tanganyika and Zanzibar united
              on 26th April 1964, forming the United Republic of Tanzania.
              Tanganyika became independent from the British on December 1961
              and Zanzibar became free through a revolution on 12th January
              1964. <br />

                The Serengeti is one of the most famous parks in Africa and is
                synonymous with wildlife and classic African scenery. It is
                Tanzania's oldest park and a Unesco World Heritage Site. It is
                home to the spectacular wildebeest migration and offers
                top-class wildlife viewing throughout the year. <br />
                <br />

                Serengeti's scenery is renowned for its grassland plains in the
                southeast. The northern part is more hilly and rocky. To the
                west, valleys, rivers and forest can be found. Several areas in
                the Serengeti are dotted with 'koppies', granite outcrops rising
                up from the plains. It's an immense landscape and quite stunning
                – big sky country that feels like untamed wilderness.

                The Zanzibar Archipelago, located in the Indian Ocean 15 miles
                off the coast of Tanzania, is a breathtaking spot to escape from
                the world. Zanzibar is a popular island with a lot of tourists
                visiting throughout the year. You’ll enjoy clear, turquoise-blue
                water; shallow sandbars perfect for wading; and many small,
                nearly deserted islands virtually unvisited by tourists. Explore
                the World Heritage Site of Stone Town, Zanzibar City’s old
                quarter. Or just go beach to beach between tiny fishing
                villages—each one's better than the next.
